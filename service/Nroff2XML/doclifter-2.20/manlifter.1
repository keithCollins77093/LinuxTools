.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmanlifter\fR
is a script that sequences
\fBdoclifter\fR(1)
to convert an entire manual\-page tree to XML\-Docbook, optionally also generating HTML from the XML\&. Another use is as a torture\-test tool for doclifter; it logs errors to standard output and collects timings\&.
.PP
Called without any file arguments, manlifter tries to convert all eligible man pages installed on the system, placing the resulting xml files under
xmlman
in the current directory\&. Each successfully translated page foo\&.N is copied to manN/foo\&.xml beneath the output directory, regardless of what source directory it came from\&.
.PP
A manual page is considered ineligible for batch conversion if it contains text indicating it has been generated from DocBook masters of from Doxygen\&.
.PP
For each source file examined, if the destination file exists and is newer than the source, the conversion is skipped; thus, incremental runs of
\fBmanlifter\fR
do the least work needed to keep the target XML tree up to date\&. Likewise, in \-h mode derived HTML files are only made when necessary\&.
.PP
Stub pages that are just
\fB\&.so\fR
redirections are translated to corresponding symlinks of XML files (and, with \-h, HTML files)\&.
.PP
\fBmanlifter\fR
may also be called with a single file argument, which is interpreted as the stem name of a potential manual page\&.
\fBmanlifter\fR
then searches all selected manual sections for a matching page and attempts to convert it\&. In this case, a copy of the man page and the converted version are dropped immediately beheath the output directory, with the names foobar\&.man and foobar\&.man\&.xml, respectively\&. This mode is normally only of interest only to
\fBdoclifter\fR
developers for debugging that program\&.
.PP
In either of the above cases,
\fBmanlifter\fR
will uncompress the file if it has a
\&.gz,
\&.bz2
or
\&.Z
suffix on the name\&.
.PP
Options are as follows:
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
Pass the string argument to each doclifter call as options\&. Each space\-separated token in the string becomes a separate argument in the call\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e
.RS 4
Run in log\-filter mode (mainly of interest to
\fBdoclifter\fR
developers)\&. In this mode,
\fBmanlifter\fR
reads a test log from standard input and filters it in a a way dependent on the \-f and \-q options\&. If neither of these is given, messages from successful runs are stripped out and only errors passed through to standard output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f
.RS 4
Normally, run doclifter on the files named by each line in the argument file\&. In error\-filter mode the argument is instead interpreted as a filtering regular expression\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Also generate HTML translations into the output directory\&. DocBook citerefentry markup is transformed to hyperlinks in the directory, and a contents listing is generated to
index\&.html\&.
.RE
.PP
\-I
.RS 4
Specify the root of the manual\-page tree\&. By default this is
/usr/share/man\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m
.RS 4
Make a patch to correct the last page fetched\&. It is copied, an editor is called on the copy (using the environment variable
\fB$EDITOR\fR), and then
\fBdiff\fR(1)
is called to drop the patch in the prepatch directory\&. Fails with an error if such a patch is already present\&.
.RE
.PP
\-M
.RS 4
Lift the specified files, then do the equivalent of the \-m option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-o
.RS 4
Set the output directory into which XML\-DocBook translations will be dropped\&. By default this is
xmlman
under the current directory in batch mode, or the current directory otherwise\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Interpret the argument as the name of a patch directory (the default name is
prepatch
under the current directory)\&. Each file named
foo\&.N\&.patch
is interpreted as a patch to be applied to the manual page foo(N) before doclifter translates it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
Normally, pass the \-q (quiet) option to each doclifter call\&. In error\-filter mode, return a list of files on which translation failed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Pass the \-v (verbose) option to each doclifter call\&. This option can be repeated to increase the verbosity level\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s
.RS 4
Specify a section to scan\&. Use this with an argument; it should not be necessary when doing a conversion of the entire tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S
.RS 4
Compile error statistics from a
\fBmanlifter\fR
logfile presented on standard input\&. This option will be of interest mainly to
\fBdoclifter\fR
developers\&.
.RE
.PP
\-X
.RS 4
In batch mode exclude pages listed in the argument file\&. Meant to be used for pages that are known good and take an extremely long time to lift, in order to cut down the time for a test run\&. (Most pages lift in less than a half second, but a few can take 15 minutes or longer\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fBmanlifter\fR
emits a logfile to standard output\&. The file begins with a timestamp line and a blank line, and ends with a line giving run time and various interesting statistics\&. Between these are stanzas, separated by blank lines, one for each file on which
\fBdoclifter\fR
was run\&.
.PP
The first line of each stanza beguns with "! ", followed by the pathname of the source manual pager, followed by "=" and the return status of doclifter run on that file\&. Following that is a space and
\fBdoclifter\fR\*(Aqs runtime in seconds\&.
.PP
This initial line may be followed by information messages and the error output of the doclifter run\&.
.PP
\fBmanlifter\fR
must find a copy of
\fBdoclifter\fR
in either the current directory or one of the command directories in your
\fBPATH\fR
in order to run\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
HTML generation is painfully slow\&. Unfortunately, there is little we can do to remedy this, because XSLT engines are painfully slow\&.
